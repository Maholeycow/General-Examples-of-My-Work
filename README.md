# General-Examples-of-My-Work
Not a specific project, more of a mash-up of my code to get a feel for how I program

You will find examples of the following languages being used (This list will grow as time passes):

C/C++ - school work, hobbyist type files. HIGHLIGHT: Used Lex and Yacc to generate a lexical analyzer & parser for a calc program
C# - Unity Game Engine, these are script files with the .cs extension
